BoardGame Data Analysis 
Board games are a specific type of tabletop game that often include pieces or counters that are moved on a board according to a certain set of rules. 
Board games vary significantly in complexity with most including an element of chance, and some being based purely on chance. For example, 
many board games require players to roll a die, which depends largely on chance, whereas others are more skill-based or focused on turn-taking.
